  # this collection will be the argument given to `print_movies`
  #  and that method will do some nice presentation stuff like puts out a list
  #  of movies by title. Have a play around with the puts with other info about a given film.

## BONUS

# that `get_character_movies_from_api` method is probably pretty long. Does it do more than one job?
# can you split it up into helper methods?
